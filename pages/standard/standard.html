<p>First we want to investigate the relationship between methylation changes and disease within the <strong>adult</strong> age group.</p>
<p>Only using adult samples we create a variable called <code>Condition</code> , which contains 3 groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>CTL.adult: the adult controls</li>
<li>AMN disease without cerebral condition</li>
<li>cAMN disease withcerebral condition.</li>

<p>Now we want to investigate differences in methylation between disease and control cases including children.</p>
<p>For that, we have combined the age group (child / adult) samples and disease phenotype (control, cerebral and non-cerebral) (CTL,cAMN,cALD,AMN) into a single variable <code>Condition</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>CTL.adult</strong>: Control samples for adults</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CTL.child</strong>: Control samples for children</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AMN</strong>: Adults with the non-cerebral disease condition</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cAMN</strong>: Adults with cerebral disease condition</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cALD</strong>: Children with cerebral disease condition</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The distribution of samples for each group is shown in the following table:</p>

<p>From the plots, the following observations can be made:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Age-Related Methylation Changes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Substantial alterations in DNA methylation patterns are evident when comparing different age groups both for the controls (<code>CTL.child</code> vs <code>CTL.adult</code>) as well as for the disease phenotypes (<code>cALD</code> vs <code>cAMN</code>) with a trend to <strong>hypomethylation</strong> in the adult cohort.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disease-Related Methylation Differences</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Distinct patterns of methylation variations are observed between the pediatric and adult cohorts afflicted with the disease.</li>
<li>Cerebral condition (<code>cAMN</code> &amp; <code>cALD</code>) show higher changes in methylation than <code>AMN</code> with respect to the controls.</li>
<li>In the <em>cerebral</em> conditions, (<code>cAMN</code> &amp; <code>cALD</code>), we observe a trend to <strong>hypermethylation</strong> compared to healthy controls, whereas in the <em>non-cerebral</em> disease condition (<code>AMN</code>) we observe <strong>hypomethylation</strong> when compared to controls. (specifically in children).</li>
<li>Few changes are observed within the adult cohort between the two disease phenotypes.</li>

<p>Next, we wanted to know to what extent can the observed methylation changes be attributed to the factor of age?</p>
<!-- In addition to being an important biological factor, there is also an imbalance in the distribution of age within the different groups.  -->

<!-- In the following table we can observe that the average age by group -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- unique(ss[,avAge,by=Condition]) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- is not balanced, which in turn makes age contribution to methylation changes to be unbalanced among comparisons: -->
<!-- Moreover, it is essential to explore the degree to which the effect of age might mask the influence of the underlying disease.  -->

<p>Model3 is an extension of the previous model <a href="#sec-Model2">Section&nbsp;3.2</a> which combines age groups and disease phenotype in the <code>Condition</code> variable. In order to better study the effect of the disease we decided to correct for age by including the age variable as a co variate to the model.</p>

<p><strong>Model4</strong> is a simplification model where we compare all controls against all cases without considering different disease phenotypes or age groups. We also correct for age here in order to remove Age effects on methylation changes. The variable of interest is named <code>Type</code> and has only two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Control: Healthy samples both for pediatric and adult samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Disease: Samples with disease phenotype.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The distribution of samples in each group is shown in the following table:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>We performed a <a href="../../pages/standard/standard.html#sec-workflow">Standard methylation analysis</a>, following our standard analysis workflow.</p>
<p>Within the adult group we don’t detect significant difference between controls and disease. Incorporating children samples, we observe few differences between children and adults with cerebral ALD/AMN but none in the other age~phenotype comparisons. Correcting for age (as a continous variable) in the analysis, confirms age as the dominating factors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the amount of changes related to age in XALD where much less than expected from previous studies (communication with colaborator).</p>
<p>For this reason (and to further study the pattern of age related changes) we propose alternative approaches:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Genereate a <a href="signature.qmd#sec-residuals">regression model with age-corrected</a> beta values, to remove the effect of age from the methylation values.</li>
<li>Look for specific age signature in our data by predicting <a href="signature.qmd#sec-inhouseref">age-related sites within the controls</a> and checking for enrichment of those sites in the disease.</li>
<li>Analysing <a href="signature.qmd#sec-PBMC">previously reported age-related sites</a> from literature.<br>
</li>
<li>Reproducing <a href="horvath.qmd">age-acceleration analysis</a> from existing literature.</li>
</ol>
