# XALD Project: Study age-related DNA methylation changes in X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD)  

This report focusses on the following questions:

1. Which DNA methylation changes are associated with XALD in adults ? 

2. XALD also occurs in children, although with a distinct phenotype. 
   Are there age-related methylation changes associated with XALD  and do XALD patients show accelarated aging compared to controls?

## Study design

In adults, there are 2 disease phenotypes AMN and cerebral AMN (cAMN), in children only one disease phenotype, cerebral XALD (cALD) [adults >=18 & child <18]. Both, children and adult have a health controls group (CTL).

Code
source("R/functions.R")
library(data.table)
ss<-readRDS("data/SS.rds")
ss$age_grp <- "Adult"
ss[Age < 18, age_grp:="Child"]
table(ss$age_grp,ss$Condition)

       
        AMN cALD cAMN CTL.adult CTL.child
  Adult  52    0    8        12         0
  Child   0   12    0         0        12
